      <h3>Ahsan Latif </h3>
      <p> This is my first time being exposed to any type of programming and I must say it has been a challenging but exciting two weeks. This bootcamp was something I thoroughly enjoyed due to the hands on and interactive nature, which has allowed me to create my own game for my project. This is something I am really proud of, with only less than two weeks of experience to this. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: 'Tap the Ball' Game!</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City University of London. This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of different variables and loops throughout. I created a game where you have to tap a bouncing ball, but whenever you tap the ball the speed increases, making it more challenging each time you tap. A tap increases your score in increments of one, whereas if you miss the ball, one of your three lives will be taken away from you. I have used different variables to change the speed each time the ball was tapped, using 'if or else' statements.
